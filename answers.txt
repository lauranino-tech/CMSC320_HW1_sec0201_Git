Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is useful because it allows multiple people to work on the same code and it allows for careful saving of our work. For example if something breaks we can go to an earlier version of the project which is saved through git. Also, if someone needs to work on just one feature of the project they can create a branch without necessarily affecting the work of other people.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to the medical field to analyze large data sets of patient information, genomic information, and medical imaging data.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rehashing?

Answer: Merging saves all the branching information whereas rehashing attempts to create a single timeline of edits meaning you have to resolve conflicts between separate branches.
